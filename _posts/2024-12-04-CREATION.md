Well, it was Wednesday, in December. I was currently in another boring class (if any of my teachers is reading that right now - sorry, but you must agree you can get pretty boring sometimes), when I decided to check my GitHub profile. I was working on WayTeX repository during that time, so it was not that random to check whole profile. And what I did not find? Six months old Github Pages tryout. Abandoned. Sad. Unused. Kinda ugly.

I thought I need to do something about it, so I deleted whole thing and thought it will be okay. But then the blank space remained. So I made research. I found Jekyll. I found Chirpy theme. I fell in love. So I recreated the repository and I must say. I was grateful. Without any work it looked good. Usable. Actually easy way to create website with control over it (maybe I have a little beef with Wordpress, maybe I absolutely hate it, but who can tell?).

But then it hit me. I do not know what half of the code is. It has this cute sidebar with links at the bottom and I have no idea where it takes links from and how to change them. Tried to add Discord there and I cannot make it to show the thing. Or page's tab icon. It still has the original icon and I cannot find where the hell is icon supposed to be.
