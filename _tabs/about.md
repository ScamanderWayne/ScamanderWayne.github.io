Hello. My name is Libor Hal√≠k, but more people know me under my internet persona, Scamander Wayne. I am nearly 20 years old student of economy high school. In Czech Republic (middle of Europe, slavic country, next to Germany and Poland for those unaware of Europe layout). English is my second language, so I just want to say sorry for some grammar errors here or there.

This page, blog (webblog?), or how do I call it, another of my projects. I should state that I am kinda hyperactive and I certainly have troubles keeping focus on boring tasks. So I learnt to make them less boring. Instead of writing papers for school in Word like every sensible human being, I started learning LaTeX. Instead of choosing English as my final graduation class (which I am supposedly good in and would have no troubles passing it), I decided for Math, just to have it somewhat harder and certainly more entertaining.

And this web is another proof. I do not know how to code. I never learnt it. I never needed it. If I remain in economy sector after graduation I will not ever need it. But it is fun. Started with modding and repairing older games, mostly into playable state, not fan of big modifications. Moved on to LaTeX where I needed to learn how code works. It is not real programming language, but I still needed more skill than to just change some values in .ini files. And now beginning of webdesign. It is entertaining to just search code and see how what works.

I think I will never need this page. But making blog posts so my classmates can read it and laugh about it is fun so far. And what do I know? Maybe this page will one day turn into my official CV.
