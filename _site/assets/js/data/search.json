    "content": "Let me get you caught up to what I was for during last six days (wait, it is really already six days?). I realised I had no idea how Jekyll themes work.So I forked whole chirpy theme. I did not really need to. All changes I did so far (I am already thinking of changing colour palette, but this can wait) could have been done without forking as well. But this way I got a look into backstage. And people, trust my word on this, it is beautiful.For example home page through which you clicked on this post. It has one compress HTML file that basically compresses everything inside into usable HTML file. than there is default HTML that calls to all elements inside. Head is a different HTML file, sidebar as well, even whole home HTML. Just many pieces placed together. And same applies for any other site.Sites ABOUT and PROJECTS are basically just markdown (.md) files not really different from these blog posts.But to my actual work.I added different links at bottom of sidebar (if you have smaller screen you could have not noticed, I am sorry for that, still did no work on that), managed to make profile picture working. Added some custom texts for descriptions and so on.But I mostly just searched through file repository, searching what calls out to what. Figuring out how it is put together."

    "content": "Well, it was Wednesday, in December. I was currently in another boring class (if any of my teachers is reading that right now - sorry, but I am sure it was not yours class; I really like your classes, it was somebody else’s), when I decided to check my GitHub profile. I was working on WayTeX repository during that time, so it was not that random to check whole profile. And what I did not find? Six months old Github Pages tryout. Abandoned. Sad. Unused. Kinda ugly.I thought I need to do something about it, so I deleted whole thing and thought it will be okay. But then the blank space remained. So I made research. I found Jekyll. I found Chirpy theme. I fell in love. So I recreated the repository and I must say. I was grateful. Without any work it looked good. Usable. Actually easy way to create website with control over it (maybe I have a little beef with Wordpress, maybe I absolutely hate it, but who can tell?).But then it hit me. I do not know what half of the code is. It has this cute sidebar with links at the bottom and I have no idea where it takes links from and how to change them. Tried to add Discord there and I cannot make it to show the thing. Or page’s tab icon. It still has the original icon and I cannot find where the hell is icon supposed to be."
